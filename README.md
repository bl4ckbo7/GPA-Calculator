# GPA-Calculator

GPA-Calculator - Helps to calculate the Grade Point Aggregate for university students' courses. 

# How it works

1. Enter total number of courses, course grades you have scored & course credits for each respective course.
2. Computes the total grade points you have earned and the total credits for all your courses
3. Finally Computes the GPA

# Example:

Total Courses/Semester: 7

**NB: Fill in the Grades and Credits, each, its total count should be equal to the total number of courses in the respective semester.**

...course GRADES here: B+ A A A A A B+

...course CREDITS here: 10 10 10 10 10 10 10

# Computation:

***Grade Points***
  
    A = 5
  
    B+ = 4
  
    B = 3
  
    C = 2
  
    D = 1
  
    E = 0

grade weight = grade point x credit; **e.g For grade 'A' ; grade weight = 5 x 10 = 50**

total grade points = total grade points + grade weight

total credits = total credits + credit

Finally, 

GPA = total grade points / total credits

**More:**

Annual GPA = SUM(GPA in each SEMESTER) / Number of SEMESTERS per Academic Year

**Bonus:** 
GPA-Calculator Fixs the GPA value to necessary precision.
